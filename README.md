### Dakota Smith C++ Open Ended Project

# Overview
This projects simulates a stock market, where users can buy and sell stock, view their portfolio, and view a list of stocks with their prices. A login feature is included, where users can create their own login, which will then create their own individual portfolio file. 

I created this for my advanced programming class, where we were given the option to create any project, as long as it contained is-a or has-a relationships. 
To run:
You will be presented with a login upon running. To create a new account, type n. You will then be prompted to create a username and password, which you can then use to log in. You will then be presented with a menu, where you can choose to (1) buy stock, (2) sell stock, (3) view your portfolio, or (4) view a list of preset stocks for buying inspiration. 

## Known Bugs
No known bugs at the moment. If two of the same stocks are entered, it will not combine them and will go with the first one.

## Citations
All code is mine.
