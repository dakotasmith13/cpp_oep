### Dakota Smith M2OEP

# Overview
This projects simulates a stock market, where users can buy and sell stock, view their portfolio, and view a list of stocks with their prices. A login feature is included,
where users can create their own login, which will then create their own individual portfolio file.
The Module 2 concepts include:
1. Component class relationship (Porfolio has a Stock)
2. File input & output (Used to create list of users, create individual user's portfolio based on username, and keep an updated list of user's stocks)

## Known Bugs
No known bugs at the moment. If two of the same stocks are entered, it will not combine them and will go with the first one.

## Future Work
In the future, I could get real time stock data so that users do not have to input the price information. I could also improve how my program goes about having two of the same stocks. 
I could also add more functionality that captures the time they bought the stock and add a timer for when the user would receive a dividend. 
Another feature could be a portfolio value, and allow users to "add funds" and verify that they can only make purchases that they can afford.

## Citations
All code is mine.

## Grade Earned
I believe I earned around 65 points. I believe my main program should earn about 30 points. Most of the work of this program is done in the classes, 
but I did add the login function which increased the complexity of main a bit. Most of my methods are tested in the program, but I feel I was able to test them effectively in 
my testing file (15). For Has-A relationship, I would say I earned about 10 points because the Stock class was pretty heavily used in Portfolio. 
I'm not sure how many times my files count for being applied, I would say that I earned 5 points for each instance (at least two instances- user login file, user portfolio).
I feel I have enough commments, everything is pretty organized, I demonstrate multiple test runs and input val, and my repo just barely spans 7 days (0 points deducted).
